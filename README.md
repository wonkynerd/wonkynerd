Hello all and welcome to env0y_susci3ty where all Altered Carbon book/tv references and anything cyberpunk are highly encouraged! 

My name is Dylann and I am a current student with American University in Washington, DC pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity and a minor 
in Computational Mathematics.I previously studied homeland security/intelligence studies at Montgomery Community College in Maryland. Professionally, I am highly interested in 
cybersecurity in general, but with emphasis on Digital Forensics and Incident Response. My long term career goal is to engage in threat hunting/malware analysis or any 
type of threat research and technical analysis. 

With the little spare time I have, I am studying for my Network+ certification and subsequently will be pursuing Security+. Additionally, I am active on HackTheBox Academy and 
Codecademy. Beginning in the spring semester of 2022 I will be the Competition Team Leader for the National Cyber League with the newly founded cybersecurity club on campus
started by a good colleague and me. We are putting together a team of students now and are looking forward to our first competition. 

On this GitHub repository, my aim is to add any school and personal projects as I complete them for future personal referece, internships, entry-level jobs, and the like.
Please notify me of any discpreancies you see in my code and I will get to work right away! 

Enjoy and I hope some of you will find my content helpful!
